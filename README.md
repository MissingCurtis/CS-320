*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I try to folow best industry practices when I write out my code, and then I move to static testing which I ensure that there is no problems with the code to start out with. My next step is to use unit testing with as much coverage as I can get to cover the cod eI have written. Functional testing ensures that everything is working how it is supposed to work. 
*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User stories give you a baseline for what that expect out of the application. I interpret those stories into features and usablity for what the user wants. That way I can meeet their expectations. I also you others to test my finished product for acceptance testing so I can get a outside view of my work.
*How do I approach designing software?
Software design is about flexablity and expectations. While we set the requirements and expectations for the application we have to be able to adjust to change needs or unforseen roadblocks that may change how the application will funtion.
